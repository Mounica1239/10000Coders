            Big Buck Bunny (code-named Project Peach) is a 2008 short
            computer-animated comedy film featuring animals of the forest, made
            by the Blender Institute, part of the Blender Foundation.[5][6] Like
            the foundation's previous film, Elephants Dream, the film was made
            using Blender, a free and open-source software application for 3D
            computer modeling and animation developed by the same foundation.
            Unlike that earlier project, the tone and visuals departed from a
            cryptic story and dark visuals to one of comedy, cartoons, and
            light-heartedness. It was released as an open-source film under the
            Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 license.[7]

            Big Buck Bunny (code-named Project Peach) is a 2008 short
            computer-animated comedy film featuring animals of the forest, made
            by the Blender Institute, part of the Blender Foundation.[5][6] Like
            the foundation's previous film, Elephants Dream, the film was made
            using Blender, a free and open-source software application for 3D
            computer modeling and animation developed by the same foundation.
            Unlike that earlier project, the tone and visuals departed from a
            cryptic story and dark visuals to one of comedy, cartoons, and
            light-heartedness. It was released as an open-source film under the
            Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 license.[7]
