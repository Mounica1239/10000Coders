        <p>Muthuvel Pandian is a retired man who leads a normal domestic life with his family. Muthuvel's son ACP Arjun
            Pandian IPS is investigating Malayali gangster Varman, who steals and smuggles idols of gods and sells them
            to buyers overseas. He confronts Varman's henchman Seenu, demanding his surrender and threatening dire
            consequences. As Arjun gets closer to nabbing Varman, he suddenly goes missing and the police department
            spreads word that he may have committed suicide. Grieving from the loss of his son and partly blaming
            himself for having raised him up to be honest and fearless like himself, Muthuvel goes after Seenu and
            murders him, disposing of the body with the help of a local taxi driver.

            Varman’s men make an attempt on Muthuvel’s grandson’s life. Muthuvel fails to convince Varman to leave him
            alone. Enraged, he decides to fight back. Muthuvel visits Narasimha, a reformed criminal who loans him four
            of his sharpest shooters. With the help of Narasimha’s men, Muthuvel blackmails and humiliates Varman. He
            then guns down Varman’s henchmen sent to kill his family. Balsingh, from whom Varman borrowed the henchmen,
            reveals that fifteen years ago Muthuvel used to be the jailer of Tihar prison, where he was extremely feared
            by the prisoners, but also helped many criminals (including Balsingh) change their ways and become
            productive members of the society, eventually gaining their respect and forming friendships.

            Muthuvel corners Varman in his hideout, but Varman reveals that Arjun is still alive and threatens to kill
            him. Eventually, Varman and Muthuvel arrive at a compromise: Varman will release Arjun in return for a
            famous antique crown that is currently secure in a temple in Andhra Pradesh. Muthuvel needs to figure out a
            way to steal the artifact without raising alarms. Muthuvel plans a heist involving actor Blast Mohan, who is
            also a trustee of the temple where the crown is held. Through various deceptions and with the help of
            another smuggler Mathew, Muthuvel eventually comes into possession of the crown and sends it back to Varman,
            after which it is revealed that the crown he sent was a fake.

            Varman frees Arjun but Arjun reveals himself as a dirty copy who wanted to be cut in on Varman's operations
            and demonstrates that he is willing to go far as to condone his own father's death in return for wealth.
            However, the fake crown also conceals a hidden camera, which transmits their entire conversation to
            Muthuvel, who listens heartbrokenly. Muthuvel, his men and Balsingh attack Varman's hideout, finishing off
            him and his men while Narasimha protects his family and Mathew destroys Varman’s smuggling operations.
            Muthuvel gives Arjun one chance to surrender. He refuses and pulls out his gun to kill his father, but is
            instead killed by snipers. The movie ends with Muthuvel watching his son being gunned down.</p>
